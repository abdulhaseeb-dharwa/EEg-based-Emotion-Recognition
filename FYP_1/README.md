# Contrastive Learning of Subject-Invariant EEG Representations for Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition

## Overview

This project focuses on applying contrastive learning techniques to EEG data for cross-subject emotion recognition. The goal is to develop subject-invariant representations of EEG signals that can improve emotion recognition performance across different individuals.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets and preprocessing scripts.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
- **src/**: Source code for model training, evaluation, and utilities.
- **docs/**: Documentation, including reports and project proposal.
- **results/**: Saved models and evaluation results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup
Clone the repository:
```

```bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install the dependencies:
```
```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

- Data Preparation
- Place your EEG dataset in the data/ directory.
- Update the data paths in the configuration files or scripts accordingly.

### Training
- To train the model, run:

```bash
Copy code
python src/train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```
### Evaluation
- To evaluate the model, run:

```bash
Copy code
python src/evaluate.py --config configs/evaluate_config.yaml
```
### Inference
-- To perform inference on new EEG data, use:

```bash
Copy code
python src/inference.py --input data/new_eeg_data.csv --output results/inference_results.csv
```
