Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summarizes data using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.).
Visualizes class distributions, EEG signal amplitudes, and correlation among features.
Data Preprocessing:

Feature Scaling: Normalize EEG data (0â€“1 range) using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler to prepare for quantum encoding.
Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA or t-SNE to reduce feature dimensions, enabling efficient quantum computation.
Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing or noisy data points.
Label Encoding:

Encode emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad) into numerical labels.
